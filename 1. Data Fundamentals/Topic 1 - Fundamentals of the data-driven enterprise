## Lesson 1 - Building a data-driven HR dashboard
Covered introduction to the module, introduced the case study for the E Learning

Credit Bank Corporation, an organisation which aims to enhance insights into HR metrics by constructing an analytics dashboard.

Main goals were to improve workforce productivity, retention, and efficiency.

The dashboard needs to bring data from sources such as:

• Employee performance data
• Engagement and culture surveys
• Recruiting software and databases

## Lesson 2 - Building a data-driven culture

Explain the value of data in modern organisations
How to generate a data-driven Culture:

• Build Relationships - Motivate and cultivate relationships with different teams to foster a data centric approach
• Choose transparency in algorithms - Simplify complex models, provide education on them, start of small even if sub-optimal. Start with user friendly data tools.
• Celebrate and embrace small wins - Use small examples to persuade stakeholders of long term benefits
• Raise data literacy - Educate and support other with the skills to navigate data-related endeavours. Early on small training can have long term benefits

Transition from Big data from small data. The more a business grows, the more legs the operations have which means there's more useful data coming in. This company growth means there's a greater need for deeper insights, predictive analytics and data-driven decision-making.

Things that can happen which indicate a move from Small data to Big data is needed:

Overwhelming data: Simple tools no longer can handle the volume, or can analyse the data.
